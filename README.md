## Tindify

Tindify is an app for people who want to browse the Spotify catalog in a more interactive
way (or millenials that can't get enough of dating app mechanics). It uses the Spotify API to display
category, playlist, and song information and allows users to curate a "Tindify" playlist by
swiping song cards left or right. Cards that are swiped left are ignored, but cards that are swiped
right are added to the users Tindify playlist, similar to how the popular dating app Tinder works.
Users can also alter their playlist by navigating to the "My Tindify" route.

The app uses React and React Spring for the front end and Node for the back end.
